Medal Predictor Project

Overview
This project aims to predict the number of medals a country is likely to win in a sporting event using linear regression. The primary objective is to analyze historical data, identify relevant features, and build a predictive model that estimates the number of medals a country could achieve.

Features
The features used for predicting the medal count may include factors such as:
team
country 
year 
athletes
age
prev_medals
medals

Data
The data used for this project is sourced from historical records of sports events, countries, teams, years, athelets, age, prev_medals, medals . Ensure you have the dataset available and properly formatted before proceeding.

Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use the provided scripts for various tasks:

data_preprocessing.py: Prepare the dataset for training.
train_model.py: Train the linear regression model.
predict.py: Use the trained model for predictions.

Model Training
Explain how the linear regression model is trained, including details on data splitting, feature scaling, and any other relevant information.

Results
The results of the model is shown as the output using linear regression model in jupyter notebook
